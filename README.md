# 18.369_project_thermal_control
My final project for the MIT class 18.369 Mathematical Methods in Nanophotonics, taught by Professor Steven Johnson. Class repo: https://github.com/mitmath/18369/tree/master

I used Meep to reproduce and extend the results from https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2015.309. The central file for my code in this repo is ilic_reproduction/18_369_project.ipynb

Meep is a numerical solver for Maxwell's equations, documented here: https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
