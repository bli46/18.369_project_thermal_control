# 18.369_project_thermal_control
This repo contains my final project code for the MIT class 18.369 Mathematical Methods in Nanophotonics, taught by Professor Steven Johnson. I used Meep to reproduce and extend the results from https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2015.309. The central file for my code in this repo is https://github.com/bli46/18.369_project_thermal_control/blob/main/ilic_reproduction/18_369_project.ipynb
